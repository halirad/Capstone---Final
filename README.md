# Income Mobilty & Childhood Poverty

This repository contains the data coding for the report and policy brief, Class Mobility in the US: Is the “American Dream” an Illusion? by Hali Radecker for Policy and Data Studio, Summer 2022.

# Project Description
The data set used in this project was collected by The Equality of Opportunity Project. The project analyzed the childhood household income data and statistics given for pooled participants. It sought to answer whether race, sex or other variables played a role in future earnings. The variables that were used and analyzed were racial density, college attendance, child’s wage rank, number of parental units in the household, the income rank for children with parents that did not own a home, and finally, the average income rank for children by race and gender over all of the household income levels. Because the data was created using a pool of participants and averages for the different variables, it was analyzed predominantly through creating visualizations. Smaller, more specific data sets were created looking at different variables over different household income levels. These files were exported and utilized to create visualizations that depicted the disparities between the races, ethnicities, and sexes.

# Running the Analysis
Step 1: Installing Programs To replicate this analysis, you will need to install R and R Studio. I created visualizations using Datawrapper and smaller, more defined data sets made using the raw data on R.
Step 2: Download the data set from The Equality of Opportunity Project: [Race and Economic Opportunity in The United States: An Intergenerational Perspective]([url](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/race/table_1.csv)), Table 1.
